      <h1>DB Relay Overview</h1>
      <p>The DB Relay application is a protocol bridge allowing HTTP clients to access to Microsoft's SQL Server and other databases. The primary goal is to make the access to supported databases easy for other (unrelated to this project) software, including Python, JavaScript, and Ruby scripts. That includes simple standards-bases request and data formats as well as the ease of installing, maintaining (log files, configuration, etc.) and managing (starting, stopping, inventorying, etc.) the application.</p>
      <p>The essense of the solution is to have the application to accept HTTP requests containing SQL queries, relay them to specified database server, and return the server's reply back to HTTP client in JSON format.</p>
      <p>The DB Relay application built from the existing and newly-developed code. Existing code includes, but not limited to, FreeTDS libraries, NGiNX web server, and other third-party software components necessary for the application. The newly-developed code includes an NGiNX module and NGiNX server modifications, needed to &quot;glue&quot; the software components into a monolithic, statically linked application.</p>
      <p>As the DB Relay application being released under the GPLv3 open-source license, all code used in DB Relay need to have a compatible license as reviewed and decided by the project maintainers before work usinge with such external existing code can be may be commited to the DB Relay repository.</p>
