      DB Relay is an HTTP module built on the NGiNX webserver platform which
      communicates with a variety of database servers and returns JSON formatted
      data.

      <h1> Features</h1>
      <p>The DB Relay application has client-facing, database-facing, and system interfaces. When referring to unspecified connections, the documentation means database server connections as opposed to HTTP connections.</p>  
      <h2>Client-facing interface</h2>
      <p>On the client-facing interface, the DB Relay application acts as a fully-functional HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 server within the abilities on the current stable NGiNX release. Additional SQL Bridge module must be built to address the DB Relay-specific functionality. The following existing NGiNX modules are be build into the server:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nginx Core</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Main Module - error log, processes, permissions, etc.</li>
            <li>Events Module - epoll, kqueue, select, poll, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Standard HTTP Modules</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>HTTP Core Module - ports, locations, error pages, aliases, and other essentials</li>
            <li>Access Module - allow/deny based on IP</li>
            <li>Auth Basic Module - HTTP authentication</li>
            <li>Browser Module - interpret &quot;User-Agent&quot; string</li>
            <li>Charset Module - recode web pages</li>
            <li>Empty GIF Module - serve a 1x1 image from memory</li>
            <li>HTTP Headers Module - set arbitrary response headers</li>
            <li>Log Module - custom access logs</li>
            <li>Rewrite Module - apply regular expressions to request URIs</li>
            <li>UserID Module - issue identifying cookies</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>HTTP modules for future consideration (from NGiNX codebase)</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>SSL Module</li>
            <li>Stub Status Module - view server statistics</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="todo">The list above needs verification.</span></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Besides the communications enabled by the existing-code modules, the DB Relay accepts specially formatted GET and POST requests containing database connectivity properties, authentication data, and a SQL query to be executed on a database server, and return to the client JSON-formatted result sets. Specifics of the request and response formats are in the <a href="interfaces.htm">Interfaces documentation</a>. The rest of the specification addresses only the features and properties of the SQL bridge module unless mentioned otherwise.</p>
      <h2>Database-facing interface</h2>
      <p>On the database-facing interface, the DB Relay application acts as a database client via a library configured at build time. It supports time-limited named persistent connections.</p>
      <h2>System interface</h2>
      <p>Eventially DB Relay will be developed to statically link into a single (monolithic) executable file without a need for any libraries other than provided by standard initial installations of target operating systems.</p>
      <p>The simpliest way to install and run DB Relay application on a system is by running it without any parameters. In this case it will come up listening on HTTP port configured in the local conf/ngins.conf file, granted standard system limitations (like user permissions or port unavailable).</p>
      <p>As the next level of configuration, the DB Relay executable will accept optional command-line parameters, including a reference to a full-blown Nginx configuration file. There command-line parameters are detailed in the <a href="interfaces.htm#command_line">Interfaces chapter</a>. The command-line parameters are not yet fully implemented and are subject to change in the future.</p>
      <h2>Data Types Conversion</h2>
      <p>The DB Relay module converts data it received from a database server as rowserts into JSON or another specified format. Number and string values are represented as such in JSON. Temporal types are returned as ISO-formatted strings. UID fields are returned as strings. Specifics of which data types are supported and how are they should be converted into JSON to return them to the requesting cliend need further documentstion <span class="todo">(need to clarify a specific ISO format and BLOB and CLOB representation)</span>.</p>
