		  <h1> Features</h1>
		  <p>The DBRelay application will have client-facing, database-facing, and system interfaces. When referring to unspecified connections, this document means SQL Server connections as opposed to HTTP connections.</p> 
			<h2>Client-facing interface</h2>
			<p>On the client-facing interface, the DBRelay application will act as a fully-functional HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 server within the abilities on the current stable Nginx release. Additional SQL Bridge module must be built to address the DBRelay-specific functionality. The following existing code modules must be build into the server:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Nginx Core</strong>
<ul>
<li>Main Module - error log, processes, permissions, etc.</li>
                  <li>Events Module - epoll, kqueue, select, poll, etc.              </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
          </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Standard HTTP Modules</strong>
<ul>
<li>HTTP Core Module - ports, locations, error pages, aliases, and other essentials</li>
                  <li>Access Module - allow/deny based on IP</li>
                  <li>Auth Basic Module - HTTP authentication</li>
                  <li>Browser Module - interpret &quot;User-Agent&quot; string</li>
                  <li>Charset Module - recode web pages</li>
                  <li>Empty GIF Module - serve a 1x1 image from memory</li>
                  <li>HTTP Headers Module - set arbitrary response headers</li>
                  <li>Log Module - custom access logs</li>
                  <li>Rewrite Module - apply regular expressions to request URIs</li>
                  <li>UserID Module - issue identifying cookies              </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Optional HTTP modules (from Nginx codebase)</strong>
<ul>
<li>SSL Module</li>
                  <li>Stub Status Module - view server statistics</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note the absence of HTTP Upstream, AutoIndex, FastCGI, GEO, Gzip, HTTP Referer, Limit Zone, Map, Memcached, Proxy, and SSI standard modules - those must not be build into the DBRelay application.</p>
            <p>If included modules rely on excluded or not mentioned modules, then GETCO LLC will decide if the dependency module should be included or dependant module should be excluded.</p>
          <p>Besides the communications enabled by the existing-code modules, the DBRelay application will accept a specially formatted GET and POST requests containing database connectivity properties, authentication data, and a SQL query to be executed on a database server, and return to the client JSON-formatted result sets. Specifics of the request and response formats are in the <a href="interfaces.htm">Interfaces chapter</a>. The rest of the specification addresses only the features and properties of the SQL bridge module unless mentioned otherwise.</p>
          <h2>Database-facing interface</h2>
<p>On the database-facing interface, the DBRelay application will act as a FreeTDS-based client compliant with TDS version 9. It will not initially include the connection pooling. It must support time-limited named persistent connections.</p>
<h2>System interface</h2>
<p>The application must be statically linked into a single (monolithic) executable file without a need for any libraries other than provided by standard initial installations of target operating systems.</p>
<p>The simpliest way to install and run DBRelay application on a system must be by running it without any parameters. In this case it must come up listening on the HTTP port 80, granted standard system limitations (like user permissions or port unavailable). It should have defaults for all configurable items and not need run-time configuration specified, using defaults specified at compile-time.</p>
<p>As the next level of configuration, the DBRelay executable must accept optional command-line parameters, including a reference to a full-blown Nginx configuration file. There command-line parameters are detailed in the <a href="interfaces.htm#command_line">Interfaces chapter</a>.</p>
<h2>Data Types Conversion</h2>
<p>The SQL Bridge module will need to do a conversion of data it received in rowsets from a database server. Specifics of which data types are supported and how would they beconverted into JSON to return them to the requesting client will be discussed as the first phase of the project and decided upon by GETCO LLC.</p>
