      <h1>Environment</h1>
      <p>The DB Relay application should run on plain installs of Linux distribution CentOS versions between 5.2 and 6.0, both 32 and 64 bit, and Mac OS X versions 10.6 and later, without development packages installed. It should compile on the same platforms with only their vendor-provided development environments installed. The HTTP capabilities on the DB Relay application should be compatible with those of Firefox version 3 and later on Mac OS X 10.5 and Windows XP and Internet Explorer version 8 or later on Windows XP.</p>
