      DB Relay is an HTTP module built on the NGiNX webserver platform which
      communicates with a variety of database servers and returns JSON formatted
      data.

      <h1>Interaction Logic</h1>
      <p>This is a general outline of the implemented logic. In the future gevelopment, the specific workflows may nee to be adjusted to address an emerging functionality.</p>
      <h2>Normal Request</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Each client request expected to contain all nesessary information to locate and authenticate into the server to run the query as well as the query itself.</li>
        <li>After receiving the client request, the DB Relay applcation checks the connection management parameters and assigns either (a) established or (b) newly created connection to the request.</li>
        <li>When a connection gets a request assigned, it should queue it's SQL query for execution on that connection. Every query should runs in an existing context, meaning, that temporary objects or other context information from previous queries on the same connection are visible and impacting the new query.</li>
        <li>The resulting datasets are formatted and returned to the client.</li>
        <li>There is a connection &quot;garbage collector&quot; functionality, which regularly destroys database connections idling beyond the timeout in effect for that connection.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="persistence">Persistence considerations</h2>
      <p>Database TCP connections are persistent beyond the HTTP response if, and only if, a connection name is provided. Multiple connections may persist under the same name, distinguished by other connection parameters. To be reused, persistent connections are referred to by the whole combination of sql_server, sql_port, sql_database, sql_domain, sql_user, sql_password (<span class="todo">should be encrypted, needs validation</span>), and connection_name. Those parameters are referred to as <em>connection hash keys</em>. Connection timeout adjusted by each query which sets it (<span class="todo">needs validation</span>).</p>
      <p>If a request comes to a named connection which is busy with another query, the request will be queued and executed in a FIFO manner. No two connections will match the same set of hash keys. The reason for these two requirements is that named persistent connection may have state, which users may need to maintain and predictably retrieve on named connections.</p>
      <p>Connection parameters are defined below in the <a href="interfaces.html#http_request">HTTP request</a> section, including the details of the <code>connection_timeout</code> parameter.</p>
      <h2>Status request</h2>
      <p>A status report on open connections, loads, timings, memory, version, etc. are available. The details of the status response are documented in the Administrative Requests of the <a href="interfaces.html">Interfaces documentation</a>.</p>
      <h2>Application shutdown</h2>
