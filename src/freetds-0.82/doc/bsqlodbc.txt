NAME
  bsqlodbc - batch SQL script processor using ODBC

SYNOPSIS
  bsqlodbc [-U username] [-P password] [-S server] [-D database]
         [-i input_file] [-o output_file] [-e error_file]
         [-t field_term] [-qv]

DESCRIPTION
  bsqlodbc is a utility program distributed with FreeTDS.

  bsqlodbc is a non-interactive equivalent of the "isql" 
  utility programs distributed by Sybase and Microsoft. Like them, bsqlodbc uses
  the command "go" on a line by itself as a separator between batches. The last
  batch need not be followed by "go".

  bsqlodbc makes use of the ODBC API provided by FreeTDS. This 
  API is of course also available to application developers.

OPTIONS
  -U username   Database server login name.

  -P password   Database server password.

  -S server	Database server to which to connect.

  -D database	Database to use.

  -i input_file  Name of script file, containing SQL.

  -o output_file  Name of output file, holding result data.

  -e error_file  Name of file for errors.

  -t field_term  Specifies the field terminator. Default is two spaces ('  '). 
  Recognized escape sequences are tab ('\\t'), carriage return ('\\r'), newline ('\\n'), 
  and backslash ('\\\\'). 

  -h  Print column headers with the data to the same file. 
  
  -q  Do not print column metadata, return status, or rowcount. Overrides -h. 

  -v  Verbose mode, for more information about the ODBC interaction.
  This also reports the result set metadata, including and return code. All
  verbose data are written to standard error (or -e), so as not to interfere 
  with the data stream.

NOTES
  bsqlodbc is a filter; it reads from standard input, writes to standard output, 
  and writes errors to standard error. The -i, -o, and -e options override 
  these, of course.

EXIT STATUS
  bsqlodbc exits 0 on success, and >0 if the server cannot process the query.

HISTORY
  bsqlodbc first appeared in FreeTDS 0.65.
