.SH DESCRIPTION 
\fBdefncopy\fP is a utility program distributed with FreeTDS. It replaces
a similar program of the same name distributed by Sybase.
.PP
\fBdefncopy\fP reads the text of a stored procedure or view, and writes a script
suitable for recreating the procedure or view. For tables, it reads 
the output of sp_help and constructs a CREATE TABLE statement, complete
with CREATE INDEX, too. 
.SH OBJECTS
.TP
.B
owner
is optional if you or the \fIdatabase\fP owner is the owner 
of the procedure/view being copied.
.TP
.B
object_name
is the name of the system object you wish to extract. 
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B
-U \fIusername\fP
\fIdatabase\fP \fIserver\fP login name.
.TP
.B
-P \fIpassword\fP
\fIdatabase\fP \fIserver\fP \fIpassword\fP.
.TP
.B
-S \fIserver\fP
\fIdatabase\fP \fIserver\fP to which to connect.
.TP
.B
-D \fIdatabase\fP
\fIdatabase\fP to use. Optional if the procedure/view being extracted is in your 
default \fIdatabase\fP. 
.TP
.B
-i \fIinput_file\fP
a script to apply to the \fIdatabase\fP. Not currently implemented. 
.TP
.B
-o \fIoutput_file\fP
a file to hold the script, defaults to standard output.
.TP
.B
-v
Show version information and copyright notice. 
.SH NOTES
\fBdefncopy\fP is a filter; it reads from standard input, writes to standard output, 
and writes errors to standard error. The -i and -o options override 
these, of course.
.PP
\fBdefncopy\fP makes use of the db-lib API provided by FreeTDS. This 
API is of course also available to application developers.
.SH EXIT STATUS
\fBdefncopy\fP exits 0 on success, and >0 if the \fIserver\fP cannot process the query.
.PP
\fBdefncopy\fP will report any errors returned by the \fIserver\fP, but will continue
processing. 
.SH HISTORY
\fBdefncopy\fP first appeared in FreeTDS 0.63.
.SH AUTHORS
The \fBdefncopy\fP utility was written by James K. Lowden <jklowden@schemamania.org>
.SH BUGS
Works only with Microsoft servers and ancient Sybase servers. 
.PP
Does not create primary keys. 
.PP
Many options are defined by Sybase that this version does not implement. Feel
free to correct this situation. 
.PP
In theory, \fBdefncopy\fP could apply/produce DDL for any system object,
but at present only tables, procedures and views are supported,
and only for extraction.
