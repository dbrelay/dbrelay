>Web browsers display this error when the underlying script didn't return any information.  The error could be in any of several places, of which <SPAN

code is PHP, some is <SPAN

the source code for each component, and software engineering debugging
skills.</P

to the <A

PHP script.  It helps to make the script as small as possible, but
still fail.  It also helps to report the version numbers of PHP, and
