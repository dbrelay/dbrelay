>About this User Guide</H1
><P
>This User Guide describes <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>FreeTDS</SPAN
> 0.82.  It is the product of (lots of) happy collaborative effort.  Although Brian's name and mine are at the top of it, behind it are many others, who contributed thoughtful suggestions, bamboozled questions, stellar prose, and terse instructions.  I don't mention this for the usual reasons (the enumeration of which I leave to you) but rather to emphasize that the purpose of our effort is to help you and those who come after you to have the easiest and most enjoyable time with <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>FreeTDS</SPAN
>.

>It is surprisingly hard, after a while, to remember how it can be for someone newly approaching a project to use it.  What seems as obvious as a fog horn to an old hand may be much more like the fog itself to the newcomer.  That can make installing and setting up new software a puzzling or frustrating experience.  You may have heard, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"It's easy if you know how."</SPAN
>  Indeed it is, and that's our purpose here: to make it easy, by letting you know how.

>FAQ</A
>, as well as links to the anonymous and browseable CVS tree.  If you find something wrong, unclear, badly put, misleading, or incorrigible, I hope you will let us know.  Post your musings or rants to the mailing list (see <A
HREF="contrib.htm"
>Helping</A
>).  Patches to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>doc/userguide.sgml</TT
> are especially welcome, of course.  By taking the time let us know what you think, perhaps the path to enlightenment will be made a little smoother for the fellow behind you.

>A few technical notes.  This guide is written in SGML DocBook format, specifications for which are found in the <A

>.  It was converted to HTML with <A
