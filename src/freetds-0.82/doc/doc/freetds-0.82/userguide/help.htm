>Successful problem isolation will yield earliest resolution.  You (believe it or not) have more information about your environment than anyone else does, and have the greatest motivation to solve your problem.  The resources at your disposal will be much more useful if the problem is specific.  (Sorry if this is obvious.  If it is, you might be surprised how often it's not.)

>If you can demonstrate the problem with <B

It can be hard for both you and the list participants &mdash; who are your allies and best resource &mdash; to determine what's going wrong.  If you can submit a script that they can use to try to reproduce your results, you have a much better chance of happy resolution.

It's a good idea to run your query through one of them &mdash; the one that uses the same API you're using &mdash; to see if it produces the same behavior you're seeing.  That helps eliminate your application (and the rest of the calling hierarchy) as a source of the problem.  </P
