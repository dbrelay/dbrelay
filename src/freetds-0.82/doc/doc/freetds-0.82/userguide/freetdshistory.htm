>In early 1997, the only option for connecting to a Sybase server from Linux or other free systems was an aging Sybase-released version of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>OpenClient</SPAN
>.  Unfortunately it had a few problems.  The original release was <CODE
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>a.out</CODE
>-based, although Greg Thain did a great service in converting the library to ELF.  Secondly, it included only the newer <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>ct-lib</SPAN
> <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</ACRONYM
>.  The older <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>db-lib</SPAN
> <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</ACRONYM
> was missing.

>Brian Bruns, a Sybase DBA and originator of the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>FreeTDS</SPAN
> project, had some <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>db-lib</SPAN
> programs he wanted to run under Linux, and thus began the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>FreeTDS</SPAN
> project. The original work focused on <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>db-lib</SPAN
> and version 5.0 of the protocol, but quickly expanded to include a <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>ct-lib</SPAN
> compatible layer and <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TDS</ACRONYM
> version 4.2.  Later support for <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>ODBC</SPAN
> and <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TDS 7.0 and 8.0</ACRONYM
> was added. Craig Spannring wrote a Java  <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>JDBC</ACRONYM
> driver which became <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>FreeTDS/JDBC</SPAN
>.

>As the project matured, it gained new participants.  Frediano Ziglio greatly expanded the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>ODBC</SPAN
> driver, and continues to improve both it and the underlying TDS library.  Bill Thompson wrote most of the present BCP system and added cursors to our <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>ct-lib</SPAN
>.  Your humble author joined the project to add documentation, and wound up as the project's maintainer.  Such are the rewards for doing a good deed.
