NAME
  osql - utility to test FreeTDS connections and queries

SYNOPSIS
  osql 	-S dsn -U username -P password [-I ini_dir]
	
DESCRIPTION

osql is a diagnostic tool provided as part of FreeTDS. It is a 
Bourne shell script that checks and reports on your configuration
files. If everything checks out OK, it invokes isql. 

osql works only with the isql that comes with unixODBC. 

OPTIONS

	-S dsn  the Data Source Name to which to connect, as known
	   to odbc.ini. 

	-U username  database login name.

	-P password  database password.

	-I ini_dir  override odbc.ini file location.

EXAMPLE

If you have an odbc.ini with a section like this:

	[myDSN]
		servername = myserver
		TDS_Version = 5.0
	
You would invoke osql as:

	osql -S myDSN [...]

NOTES

If you can connect with "osql -S servername -U user -P passwd", your 
FreeTDS ODBC installation is working. 

osql guesses where unixODBC might look for its odbc.ini by examining
the binary. This is not always an effective approach. If it doesn't work, 
you'll receive a report of candidate strings. Kindly pass along the output 
to help improve the guessing. 

If osql cannot intuit your odbc.ini directory, you can force the issue with 
the -I option. However, you're instructing osql what to test, not where 
unixODBC will eventually look. Your override is therefore only as good as 
you are. Look carefully at the error output before overriding. 

If you have suggestions for ways to make osql more useful as a diagnostic tool,
please post them to the FreeTDS mailing list. 

HISTORY

osql first appeared in FreeTDS 0.65.
