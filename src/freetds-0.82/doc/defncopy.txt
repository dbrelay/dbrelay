NAME
  defncopy - extract procedures and views from a Microsoft server. 

SYNOPSIS
  defncopy [-U username] [-P password] [-S server] [-D database]
         [-i input_file] [-o output_file] [-v]
        [owner.]object_name [[owner.]object_name...]

DESCRIPTION 
  defncopy is a utility program distributed with FreeTDS. It replaces
  a similar program of the same name distributed by Sybase.

  defncopy reads the text of a stored procedure or view, and writes a script
  suitable for recreating the procedure or view. For tables, it reads 
  the output of sp_help and constructs a CREATE TABLE statement, complete
  with CREATE INDEX, too. 

OBJECTS
  owner         is optional if you or the database owner is the owner 
                of the procedure/view being copied.

  object_name    is the name of the system object you wish to extract. 

OPTIONS
  -U username   database server login name.

  -P password   database server password.

  -S server	database server to which to connect.

  -D database	database to use. Optional if the procedure/view being extracted is in your 
                default database. 

  -i input_file  a script to apply to the database. Not currently implemented. 

  -o output_file  a file to hold the script, defaults to standard output.

  -v  Show version information and copyright notice. 

NOTES
  defncopy is a filter; it reads from standard input, writes to standard output, 
  and writes errors to standard error. The -i and -o options override 
  these, of course.

  defncopy makes use of the db-lib API provided by FreeTDS. This 
  API is of course also available to application developers.

EXIT STATUS
  defncopy exits 0 on success, and >0 if the server cannot process the query.

  defncopy will report any errors returned by the server, but will continue
  processing. 

HISTORY
  defncopy first appeared in FreeTDS 0.63.

AUTHORS
  The defncopy utility was written by James K. Lowden <jklowden@schemamania.org>

BUGS
  Works only with Microsoft servers and ancient Sybase servers. 

  Does not create primary keys. 
  
  Many options are defined by Sybase that this version does not implement. Feel
  free to correct this situation. 

  In theory, defncopy could apply/produce DDL for any system object,
  but at present only tables, procedures and views are supported,
  and only for extraction.
