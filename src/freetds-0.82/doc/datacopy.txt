NAME
  datacopy - move table data between two servers
SYNOPSIS
  datacopy { -t | -a | -c owner } [-b batchsize] [-p packetsize] [-v] [-d]
           [-S server/username/password/database/table_or_view]
           [-D server/username/password/database/table]

DESCRIPTION
  datacopy is a utility distributed with FreeTDS. 
  datacopy will move table data from one server to another without
  the need for intermediate files. datacopy is much faster
  and more efficient than is freebcp out/in.

  datacopy makes use of the db-lib bcp API built into FreeTDS. This 
  API is also available to application developers.

  datacopy can be used to migrate data between Sybase ASE and SQL Server
  or vice versa.

OPTIONS
  -t            Truncate target table before loading data.
  -a            Append data to target table.
  -c owner      Create the target table with the same schema as the source
                table. datacopy will submit a 'create table' command on 
                the target server/database using the specified owner in 
                the command, e.g. CREATE TABLE owner\.table (...).  

  -b batchsize  The number of rows per batch of data copied. 
                Each batch of data is effectively 'committed'
                to the database. The default is 1000. 

  -p packetsize  The number of bytes, per network packet, sent to 
                and from the servers. Increased packet size can enhance 
                performance.

  -v            Produce verbose output, including diagnostic timings.
  -d            Produce freetds TDSDUMP output. (Serious debug only!)

  -S server/username/password/database/table_or_view  
  		The connection information for the source server
                and the location/name of the table (or view) to be copied.
                If not specified, datacopy will prompt the 
		user for the information.

  -D server/username/password/database/table  
  		The connection information for the destination server
                and the location/name of the target table.
                If not specified, datacopy will prompt the 
                user for the information.
