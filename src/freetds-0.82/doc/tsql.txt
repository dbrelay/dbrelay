NAME
  tsql - utility to test FreeTDS connections and queries
SYNOPSIS
  tsql 	{ -S servername [-I inside] | -H hostname -p port } 
 	-U username [-P password] [-o options]
	
  tsql	-C

DESCRIPTION

tsql is a diagnostic tool provided as part of FreeTDS. It uses the TDS
protocol directly to connect to Sybase or Microsoft SQL Servers, and allows
the user to issue queries that test the capabilities of FreeTDS. 

tsql is *not* a replacement for a complete isql, such as sqsh (www.sqsh.org). 
It is designed to rely on the lowest level FreeTDS library, tdslib, as a way to
isolate potential bugs in the protocol implementation. 

tsql can be run in two ways, one which uses the freetds.conf and one which
connects directly using the server's hostname and port. 

When -S is used, FreeTDS uses the freetds.conf (or equivalent) and environment
variables in the normal way to determine the server's ip address and port. You
can use -I to specify a filename, overriding FreeTDS's configuration file
search algorithm. 

The -H and -p parameters are provided especially for troubleshooting new
configurations (or servers). Use of these parameters causes FreeTDS to ignore
any freetds.conf and environment variables. 


OPTIONS

	-S servername  the Database Server to which to connect.

	-I inside  a freetds.conf or interfaces file describing servername

	-H hostname  the DNS hostname of the server

	-p port  the port at which SQL Server is listening

	-U username  database login name.

	-P password  database password.
	
	-C  prints some of the compile-time configuration parameters.  

	-o options  apply the options specified to every command.
		f      No footer       [result count]
		h      No header       [titles]
		t      Print time
		v      Print version
		q      Quiet

NOTES

Typing "exit", "quit", or "bye" (or ^D) exits tsql. 

Typing "version" displays the TDS protocol version. 

Command batches may be separated with "go" or "GO". If "GO", the version
string is reported before executing the batch. 

If you can connect with "tsql -S servername", your basic FreeTDS installation
is working. 

If you have suggestions for ways to make tsql more useful as a diagnostic tool,
please recommend them to the FreeTDS mailing list for consideration. 

HISTORY

tsql first appeared in FreeTDS 0.60.

Several, to be sure, now that it's documented. :)
